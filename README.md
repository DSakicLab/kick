Overview<br>
Over the years, stochastic search procedure for generating starting structures on the potential energy surface has evolved from 50 lines of Fortran code with simple and rugged idea, to a variety of different flavors and variants. Here, some of those are presented, and implemented in a web-page variant using javascript.<br>

Introduction<br>
This is a quick guide in evolution of "KICK" stochastic search procedure. 
It has had many iterations in the past 16 years in our research group (Vrček-Šakić), including moving from FORTRAN to c++, then rewriting from c++ to bash for usage in command line without compiler, and lastly rewritten in javascript for usage in web-pages.<br>

The original paper that started everything: 
"Stochastic Search for Isomers on a Quantum Mechanical Surface" M. Saunders, J. Comput. Chem. 2004, 25, 621 - 626. 
was published in 2004, and has been cited 177 times (2020).

Overview<br>
Over the years, stochastic search procedure for generating starting structures on the potential energy surface has evolved from 50 lines of Fortran code with simple and rugged idea, to a variety of different flavors and variants. Here, some of those are presented, and implemented in a web-page variant using javascript.

Introduction
This is a quick guide in evolution of "KICK" stochastic search procedure. 
It has had many iterations in the past 16 years in our research group (Vrček-Šakić), including moving from FORTRAN to c++, then rewriting from c++ to bash for usage in command line without compiler, and lastly rewritten in javascript for usage in web-pages.

Two other approaches are:
Coalescence Kick in c++ by Boris Averkiev (https://github.com/averkiev75/Coalescence-Kick) and SnippetKick (https://github.com/HumanOsv/SnippetKick) in Perl by Osvaldo Yañez Osses.

The original paper was published in 2004, and has been cited 177 times (2020).
